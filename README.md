Project Documentation

This documentation details the fundamental components, functionalities, and design principles of a modular project developed using the Unity game engine. The project includes key elements such as player progression, resource management, dynamic production mechanics, and an inventory system. All save/load operations are standardized via the ISaveable interface, allowing components to be easily integrated into the centralized SaveLoadManager through drag-and-drop in the Inspector.
